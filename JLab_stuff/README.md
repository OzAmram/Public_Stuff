This is some code that I wrote in ROOT while I was at JLab.

The Lorentz transform stuff is just an example of how to use that part of the
ROOT library.

The Spectator Tagging has interesting parts of ROOT code that are commented
pretty well. I removed all the theory fortran code that generated the events
but I kept some outputs, so it might still run or it might not.
